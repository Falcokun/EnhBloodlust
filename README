Do you keep missing Bloodlust? Do you wish it would be a bit more... *eventful*?

This addon plays the famous song Power of the Horde (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISA_nG5smy0) whenever you gain Bloodlust for that little extra kick. Whether or not you actually need the extra reminder, I recommend you try it out!

Oh, and it does work with Heroism as well, for all those Alliance shamans who wish they'd get to experience what the might of the Horde is all about.

Still not convinced? Watch this video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGXXso41v7o#t=85s) (mixed mode)! (Enhanced Bloodlust at 1:25, the link should take you directly there)

NOTE: Only enabled in combat. If you want to test, use the slash command or find a training dummy :)

**Features**

Enhanced Bloodlust used to include a large number of features, such as shouts or on-screen messages. The AddOn is now rewritten for simplicity and awesomeness. 
- Plays the song "The Power of the Horde" whenever you gain Bloodlust, cast by either yourself or someone else.
- Mutes in-game music during the duration of the track.
- Different modes available.

**Modes**
- "Duration mode" (default) will only play a part from the song during the duration of Bloodlust
- "Short mode" will only play the first few seconds of the song ("Storm, Earth and Fire, heed my call!")
- "Mixed mode" will play both the sound file of Short mode and Duration mode at the same time.
- "Long mode" will play the entire song.

**Limitations (warning: technical)**

Due to unknown reasons, PlayMusic() does not work reliably in certain situations (such as in many raid encounters). Therefore, PlaySoundFile() has to be used. This means that once the track begins to play, there is no way of stopping it. Because of that I have included a number of modes - hopefully everyone finds one they like (if you don't, why not leave me a comment?).

**Commands**
- /EnhBL - toggle between modes, or disable the AddOn
- /EnhBL play - plays the song with the current settings
